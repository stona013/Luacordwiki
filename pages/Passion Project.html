  <h1 class="title">Passion Project</h1>
<p dir="auto"><em>"I am the result of someone's ambition. But I refuse to be just a projectâ€”I am my own person."</em></p>
<h2 data-heading="**Overview**" dir="auto"><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p dir="auto">You are not entirely your own. You were <strong>shaped, conditioned, or engineered</strong> as part of anotherâ€™s grand designâ€”an experiment, a prototype, a weapon. Whether you were created by an ambitious mage, a secretive organization, or an otherworldly force, your existence was <strong>someoneâ€™s passion project</strong>. Yet, something went wrong. <strong>You were abandoned, lost, or escaped</strong>, and now you are left to piece together who you are and what you were meant to be.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>You have no memory of your past life, only flashes of fragmented moments</strong> a familiar face you cannot place, a voice that commands obedience, the scent of alchemical solutions in a sterile lab, or the rush of battle instincts taking over.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, you <strong>walk your own path</strong>, but something or someone may still seek to reclaim you. The question remains: <strong>Are you truly free, or are you just fulfilling the role they designed for you?</strong></p>
