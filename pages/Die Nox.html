  <h1 class="title">Nox</h1>
<p dir="auto">In the depths of the Underdark, at a time most species had not even gained their sentience yet, dwelled a small colony of bat-like humanoids in the pursuit of knowledge. They did not know how they came to be, what their purpose was, not even the fact that there was far more to this world than endless caverns and rocks.&nbsp; curiosity&nbsp; But something deep underneath the unending caverns of the Underdark was calling out for them.</p>
<p dir="auto">Eventually this â€˜somethingâ€™ was thought to be a mineral, which in the common&nbsp; tongue is known as Animalith, a quarz like material with arcane properties they quickly learned to manipulate in their favor.</p>
<p dir="auto">Today, this mineral is one of the cornerstones of Nox society and said to be the whole reason they evolved into the highly technically advanced creatures they are.</p>

<h4 data-heading="**Race Names**" dir="auto"><strong>Race Names</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">When choosing a name for their offspring, Nox don't really differentiate between sexes and simply choose something that sounds right to their ears. Surnames on the other hand are fairly important and unique to each family of Nox. If an individual meets another Nox with the same Surname, they can be fairly certain they are related in some way or another.</p>
<p dir="auto">Nox names tend to sound clicky, crackly and harsh and can be quite hard to pronounce for foreign speakers.</p>
