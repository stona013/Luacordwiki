  <h1 class="title">Oath of Liberation</h1>
  <p dir="auto">Paladins who swear the Oath of Liberation answer a single command: no bond is eternal, no wall unassailable. 
    They are siegebreakers in shining mail, wielding divine power not to conquer but to pry open every prison, whether wrought of iron bars, tyrannical decrees, or crippling fear.
     In their creed, mercy is offered to the shackled, never to the jailer. Deliberation yields to decisive action, for hesitation grants oppressors time to tighten their grip. 
     Where a Liberator walks, locks fail, chains turn to dust, and the first gasp of freedom spreads through the crowd like fire along dry wheat. 
     Kingdoms welcome them as heroes, until those same realms forget that laws can also be cages.</p>
<h4 data-heading="**Tenets of Liberation:**" dir="auto"><strong>Tenets of Liberation:</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">Break Every Chain:<br>
No unlawful bond, physical, magical, or political deserves to stand.</p>
<p dir="auto">Expose the Stronghold:<br>
Fortifications that shelter tyranny must be breached so others may judge what lies within.</p>
<p dir="auto">Strike Without Delay:<br>
Hesitation grants oppressors time to tighten their grip. Act the moment injustice appears.</p>

<h4 data-heading="**Channel Divinity**" dir="auto"><strong>Channel Divinity</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">At 3rd level you gain two options; you can use only one Channel Divinity per short or long rest.</p>
<h4 data-heading="**Chainbreaker**" dir="auto"><strong>Chainbreaker</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">When you or a creature you can see within 30 ft has or gains the grappled, restrained, paralyzed, stunned, petrified, charmed, or frightened condition (or is bound by mundane restraints), you can use your reaction and expend your Channel Divinity. Choose one such effect on that creature; the effect ends immediately and non-magical bonds crumble. You can activate Chainbreaker even while you are the affected target, bypassing the usual action restrictions of those conditions.</p>
<h4 data-heading="**Sundering Verdict**" dir="auto"><strong>Sundering Verdict</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">&nbsp;As a bonus action choose one creature, construct, or object within 30 ft. For the next 1 minute:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">All weapon attacks by you and ignore that targetâ€™s resistances.</li>
<li dir="auto">Its immunities are treated as resistances instead.</li>
<li dir="auto">If the target is an object, structure, or construct, each hit against it rolls one extra weapon-damage die.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 data-heading="**7th-Level Feature**" dir="auto"><strong>7th-Level Feature</strong></h4>
<h4 data-heading="**Aura of Release**" dir="auto"><strong>Aura of Release</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">Your oath radiates a field that slackens chains and opens lanes where none existed.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Freedom Aura</strong><br>
While you are conscious, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet benefit from all three effects below:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">You have advantage on saving throws and ability checks made to resist, end, or avoid the following: grappled, restrained, frightened, charmed, stunned, petrified, any forced movement that would move you against your will.</li>
<li dir="auto">Non-magical difficult terrain inside the aura costs no extra movement.</li>
<li dir="auto">A friendly creature that begins its turn in the aura does not provoke opportunity attacks that turn.  </li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Expanding Presence<br>
At 18th level, the auraâ€™s radius increases to 30 feet.</p>
<hr>
<h4 data-heading="**15th-Level Feature**" dir="auto"><strong>15th-Level Feature</strong></h4>
<h4 data-heading="**Sundering Smite**" dir="auto"><strong>Sundering Smite</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">When you hit a creature, construct, or unattended object with a weapon attack, you can expend a spell slot to unleash Sundering Smite. The attack deals its normal Divine Smite radiant damage and triggers the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Until the start of your next turn, the targetâ€™s AC is reduced by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).  </li>
<li dir="auto">For that same duration, the target loses all damage resistances, and any damage immunities it has are instead treated as resistances. </li>
<li dir="auto">&nbsp;If the target is an unattended object or magical barrier (including wall of force, wall of stone, and similar effects) of Large size or smaller, the struck section is destroyed outright. Larger structures instead take maximum weapon damage from the hit.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">You can apply Sundering Smite once per turn.</p>
<hr>
<h4 data-heading="**20th-Level Feature**" dir="auto"><strong>20th-Level Feature</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 data-heading="**Avatar of Liberation**" dir="auto"><strong>Avatar of Liberation</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">At 20th level you can manifest the pure force of your oath, becoming a living mandate that no chain may endure. As an action you assume your avatar form; it lasts 1 minute, ends early if you fall unconscious, and canâ€™t be used again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<ol>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Unbreakable Form</strong><br>
You are immune to the conditions grappled, restrained, charmed, frightened, stunned, and petrified. You cannot be moved against your will, and magical or mundane restraints fall away the moment they touch you.  </li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Walking Breach</strong><br>
You ignore all difficult terrain and can move through creaturesâ€™ spaces without provoking opportunity attacks. Squares you leave are considered clear terrain for allies until the start of your next turn.  </li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Unending Sundering</strong><br>
Each time you hit with a weapon attack the target is automatically affected by Sundering Smite, but the effect does not stack.</li>
</ol>
