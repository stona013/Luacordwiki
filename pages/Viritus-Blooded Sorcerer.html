  <h1 class="title">Viritus-Blooded Sorcerer</h1>
<p dir="auto">The power of the <a data-href="Viritus" href="Viritus" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Viritus</a> Clan flows through your veins, a result of the clanâ€™s ancient and ruthless experiments conducted in pursuit of perfection and dominance. Originating from the Gin and residing on the continent of <a data-href="Sarra" href="Sarra" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sarra</a>, the Viritus Clan is one of the Sovereignsâ€”a ruling elite whose influence and might shape the destiny of nations. Though the experiments of the Viritus Clan have long faded into history, their potent bloodline occasionally awakens within unsuspecting individuals, transforming them into vessels of decay and destruction.</p>
<p dir="auto">When this dormant power manifests, it does so with dramatic and often terrifying results. The awakening might cause nearby plants to wither, metal objects to corrode, or even living creatures to fall ill. Such displays mark the individual as one of Viritus-blood, an event that does not go unnoticed. The High Houses of <a data-href="Sarra" href="Sarra" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sarra</a>, who maintain control over the Viritus legacy, swiftly claim these awakened individuals. Whether willingly or by force, those who carry this bloodline are taken from their families and brought to the High Houses to undergo rigorous training and indoctrination.</p>
<p dir="auto">For those claimed by the High Houses, life becomes a delicate balance of privilege and servitude. The powers of the Viritus bloodline are revered and feared, granting their bearers a position of significance. Yet this comes at the cost of autonomy, as they are molded into tools for the clanâ€™s ambitions. Some embrace this new life, finding pride in their heritage, while others resent the loss of their freedom, longing for the families and lives they were torn away from.</p>

<h3 data-heading="**Viritus-Blooded Sorcerer Quirks**" dir="auto"><strong>Viritus-Blooded Sorcerer Quirks</strong></h3>
<p dir="auto">Every Viritus-Blooded Sorcerer undergoes a dramatic transformation upon awakening their bloodline. <strong>Onyx-black horns</strong> sprout from their head, curving in shapes unique to each individual, and their <strong>eyes turn crimson</strong>, glowing faintly in dim light. Beyond these universal changes, the Viritus blood manifests uniquely in each sorcerer.

<h3 data-heading="**Level 1: Corrosive Essence**" dir="auto"><strong>Level 1: Corrosive Essence</strong></h3>
<p dir="auto">When you awaken your Viritus bloodline, your magic is infused with an aura of decay that weakens your enemies. You can expend one use of your <strong>Corrosive Essence</strong> to unleash this destructive power:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">When you deal damage to a creature with a spell or cantrip that deals <strong>necrotic</strong> or <strong>acid</strong> damage, you can enhance the effect, forcing the target to endure additional decay. The creature is immediately affected by one of the following effects of your choice:
<ul>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>Corrosion:</strong> The targetâ€™s AC is reduced by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> The targetâ€™s weapon attacks deal reduced damage by <strong>1d6+your sorcerer level</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>Decay</strong>: At the start of each of the target's turns, they take 1d6 necrotic damage as the corruption eats away at them. The damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">At the end of each of the creatureâ€™s turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, the effect ends.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4 data-heading="**Level 1: Enhanced Vision**" dir="auto"><strong>Level 1: Enhanced Vision</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">Your transformation grants you supernatural sight. You can see in darkness (both magical and nonmagical) up to 120 feet.</p>
<hr>
<h3 data-heading="**Level 6: Decay Mist**" dir="auto"><strong>Level 6: Decay Mist</strong></h3>
<p dir="auto">At 6th level, your mastery of decay allows you to shield yourself with a corrosive mist that weakens those who strike you.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Decay Mist</strong>: When a creature within 30 feet of you targets you with an attack, you can use your reaction to release a burst of toxic mist that targets only the attacker. The attacker must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes necrotic or acid damage equal to your level and suffers the following effects until the start of your next turn:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.</li>
<li dir="auto">The creatureâ€™s attack deals <strong>half damage</strong> (rounding down) to you.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">On a successful save, the creature takes half as much necrotic or acid damage and suffers no additional effects.</p>
<hr>
<h3 data-heading="**Level 14: Aura of Decay**" dir="auto"><strong>Level 14: Aura of Decay</strong></h3>
<p dir="auto">At 14th level, you channel the full destructive power of your Viritus bloodline into an aura of decay and corrosion that weakens enemies and draws strength from their destruction.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Aura of Decay</strong>: As a bonus action, you activate an aura of decay that radiates out in a 15-foot radius around you for 1 minute. While the aura is active, the following effects occur:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Corrosive Weakness</strong>: Enemies within the aura have their AC reduced by an amount equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up).</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Dying Breath</strong>: When an enemy within the aura is reduced to 0 hit points, you regain <strong>1 Sorcery Point</strong>. You can regain a maximum number of Sorcery Points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) per long rest.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Vulnerability to Decay</strong>: Enemies within the aura have disadvantage on saving throws against your <strong>necrotic</strong> or <strong>acid</strong> damage spells.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, you can spend <strong>1 Sorcery Point</strong> to extend the radius of the aura by 15 feet per Sorcery Point spent (up to a maximum of 60 feet).<br>
You can use this feature once per long rest.</p>
<hr>
<h3 data-heading="**Level 18: Sovereign of Decay**" dir="auto"><strong>Level 18: Sovereign of Decay</strong></h3>
<p dir="auto">At 18th level, As a Action you can activate the full power of your&nbsp;<strong>Viritus bloodline</strong>, transforming into a being of pure decay and destruction. For 1 minute, you embody the destructive force of your bloodline, and gain the following benefits for 1 Minute:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Form of Corrosion</strong>: Your body becomes infused with corrosive energy. Any creature that hits you with a melee attack takes necrotic damage equal to your level.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Decaying Resilience</strong>: You gain <strong>immunity</strong> to <strong>necrotic</strong> and <strong>acid</strong> damage.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Unstoppable Decay</strong>: You can cast <strong>Disintegrate</strong> once without expending a spell slot. The spell deals <strong>necrotic or acid</strong> damage instead of force damage. Also each of your&nbsp;<strong>Necrotic</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Acid</strong>&nbsp;Spell is effected by your&nbsp;<strong>Corrosive Essence Feature</strong>&nbsp;without spending a charge of it.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Regeneration of the Withered</strong>: At the start of each of your turns while in this form, you regain hit points equal to two times your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Once you use this action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 Sorcery Points to use it again.</p>
