<h4 data-heading="**Chromatic Energy**" dir="auto"><strong>Chromatic Energy</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto"><strong>3rd-level Path of Chromatic Rage feature</strong><br>
The elemental essence of your dragon burns within you, lashing out at those who dare to strike you. When an enemy attacks, they feel the sting of your wrathâ€”the scorching heat of fire, the caustic bite of acid, or the numbing chill of frost. This reactive energy is a constant reminder of your draconic might, growing more potent as your power deepens.</p>
<p dir="auto">While raging, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, they take damage equal to your <strong>Constitution modifier</strong> of the damage type associated with your scale color.<br>
At 10th level, this damage increases to twice your <strong>Constitution modifier</strong>.</p>

<h4 data-heading="**Will of the Dragon**" dir="auto"><strong>Will of the Dragon</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto"><strong>6th-level Path of Chromatic Rage feature</strong><br>
The presence of dragons is awe-inspiring, and you have learned to wield a fraction of that majesty in your dealings with others. Your words, steeped in draconic authority, can sway allies and cow foes alike. When you speak, it is with the confidence of one who has stared into the eyes of dragons and walked away unscathed. Whether you inspire terror or command respect, your voice carries the undeniable weight of the dragonâ€™s will.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">You gain proficiency in either <strong>Intimidation</strong> or <strong>Persuasion</strong> (your choice).</li>
<li dir="auto">When you make an <strong>Intimidation</strong> or <strong>Persuasion</strong> check, you can add your <strong>Constitution modifier</strong> to the roll.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 data-heading="**Voice of the Dragon**" dir="auto"><strong>Voice of the Dragon</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto"><strong>10th-level Path of Chromatic Rage feature</strong><br>
At this stage, your connection to dragons deepens, allowing you to channel their terrifying roars in battle. With a single shout, you strike fear into the hearts of your enemies, force them to focus their attacks on you, or unleash a blast of elemental fury. The sound of your roar reverberates like a dragonâ€™s, a powerful echo of the creatures whose might you emulate. In these moments, you are a true avatar of dragonkind, your voice shaking the battlefield.</p>
<p dir="auto">At 10th level, you can unleash a powerful dragon roar as a bonus action. Choose one of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Frightful Roar:</strong> Each creature of your choice within 30 feet must make a <strong>Wisdom saving throw</strong> (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) or become frightened of you. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on a success.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Taunting Roar:</strong> Each creature of your choice within 30 feet must make a <strong>Wisdom saving throw</strong> (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against any target other than you until the end of its next turn.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Furious Roar:</strong> Each creature in a 30-foot cone must make a <strong>Dexterity saving throw</strong> (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 damage of the type associated with your scale color. On a success, the creature takes half damage.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses after finishing a long rest.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>14th-level Path of Chromatic Rage feature</strong><br>
Your body has reached its pinnacle, adapting fully to the power of the dragon. When you rage, you take on an almost draconic formâ€”your skin toughens with elemental energy, granting you resilience against harm, and your senses sharpen to supernatural levels. The elemental power within you no longer merely protectsâ€”it makes you unstoppable, imbuing you with the enduring spirit and strength of a dragonâ€™s heart.</p>
<p dir="auto">When you enter a rage, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">You gain temporary hit points equal to <strong>2 Ã— your barbarian level</strong>.</li>
